## World’s Easiest Tic Tac Toe Game

Do you want to play a game that is so easy, you can win every time? Then try this web based tic tac toe game that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You play against the PC oponent but don’t worry, the oponent is not very smart. In fact, it is the world’s dumbest PC oponent.

### How to play 
    Open the URL in your favourite web browser.
    Just follow the same rules as the normal tic tac toe game. You need to get three of your symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
    You were assigned the symbol X. The oponent is naturally O.
    Click anywhere on the board and start the game.
    The oponent will always make the worst possible move, so you can easily beat it. It will never block your winning moves, and it will never make its own winning moves. It will just randomly place its symbol on the board.
    If you want to challenge yourself, you can try to lose on purpose. But that might be harder than you think.
    No worries, you can always restart the game by clicking on the "restart game" button.

### Why you should play

    This game is perfect for relaxing and having fun. You don’t need to think too hard or stress about losing. You can just enjoy the simple pleasure of winning every time.
    This game is also great for boosting your confidence and self-esteem. You can feel like a genius and a champion as you outsmart the computer and dominate the board.

### About development
